# project-tic-tac-toe

This project is part of **The Odin Project** and focuses on building a modular, interactive Tic Tac Toe game. It demonstrates JavaScript skills through the use of the module pattern, factory functions, and DOM manipulation to create an engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Supports alternating turns between two players.
- **Modular Architecture**: Uses the module pattern for clean, organized code and factory functions for player objects.
- **Game Reset**: Automatically resets the game after a win or tie.
- **Responsive UI**: Game layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup language for structuring the game board and UI.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the layout and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Handles game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and UI updates.
- **Module Pattern**: For clean separation of logic into reusable modules (e.g., gameBoard, gameController).
- **Factory Functions**: To create player objects with game logic encapsulated.
